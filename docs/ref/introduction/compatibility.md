# Compatibility

This section outlines the supported platforms, versions, and dependencies for deploying Wazuh using `wazuh-ansible`. Ensuring compatibility is essential for a successful deployment.

It is important to note that since the Wazuh refactoring, wazuh-ansible is now only compatible with Wazuh version 6.0 and later.

Tambien es importante que revise la documentacion oficial de Ansible para asegurarse de que su nodo de control cumple con los requisitos de compatibilidad.
